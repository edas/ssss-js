Fork Notes
==========

This version has been forked from <https://github.com/lbeder/ssss-js> and has been modified to have a more modern clean version:

- Update dependencies and fix deprecations
- Fix failing tests and linter rules, remove console.log
- Use native WebCrypto and BigInt
- Move to ES6 modules
- Build through Vite

The core should be unchanged in security and behavior

The lbeder's version was itself forked from <https://github.com/gburca/ssss-js> and has been extended to include the following features:

1. Extension/generation of additional shares from an existing threshold of shares.
2. Support for raw entropy export/import. Please note that raw entropy is serialized as-is into the coefficients of the polynomial; therefore, it must be of the exact length. Please be aware that using raw entropy can be risky. It is crucial to ensure that you are using a source of strong and high-quality entropy.

Original Notes
==============

This project is a JavaScript version of [Shamir's Secret Sharing
Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing). It has 2
distinguishing features:

1. It is interoperable and compatible with B. Poettering's Linux `ssss` utility
   (`ssss-split` and `ssss-combine`) from <http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/> so
   keys/shares can be created with one and recovered with the other. That
   project was used as the reference implementation for this project.
2. It consists of a single `html` file which includes everything needed to
   split and combine a secret (no network connection needed). As a result it is
   fully usable from Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, and other operating systems with
   a modern browser.

There are some other implementations of Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme (SSSS)
floating around, but none seem to be compatible with each other. The Linux
utility is great (which is why this project is compatible with it), but chances
are the people you want to share the secret with are not running Linux.

The author of the Linux utility maintains a web page where the utility can be
demo'd, but the author notes that it's not secure and should not be used for
sensitive data.

The [ssss.html](https://ebixio.com/ssss.html) file generated by this project
has no server dependencies (or any other external dependencies) and is as
secure as the browser or PC it's being used on. Additionally, it eliminates the
need to rely on a 3rd party web site page that may or may not be available in
the future.


Usage
=====


````
import ssss from './ssss.js';
const threshold = 3;
const shares = 5; // only important for `split`
const hexInput = false;
const s = new ssss(threshold, numShares, hexInput);

// generate keys
const prefix = "20251231"; // may not contain "-" 
const secret = "my little secret"; // ascii for hexInput=false
const [keys] = s.split(secret, prefix, options);


// recover the secret
conse usedKeys = keys.slice(0, 3);
const recoveredSecret = s.combine(usedKeys);

// generate missing or new keys
const newShare = s.extend(keys, threshold, token); 
```

Build
=====

Install dependencies: `pnpm install` then run the example through `pnpm run dev`

You can run the linter and tests through `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run test`

A build could be generated through `pnpm run build`
